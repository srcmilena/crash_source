        <h2 style="color: rgb(43, 226, 156);">About me</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">My name is Milena and, professionally speaking, I am a full-stack developer. I am 22 years old and I am from Brazil, currently living in SÃ£o Paulo capital. </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(43, 226, 156);">A hobby</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">I love sports, watching series, spending quality time with my friends and family, passionate about technology and more.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(43, 226, 156);">Food that I like</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">I <em>LOVE</em> italian food (pasta) but my favorite is my national food.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(43, 226, 156);">A sport I play and/or love watching</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Well, this is a little hard to answer because I'm a sport lover. Sport gives me a different feeling and it does not matter which one because the there is an universal energy. But I would say that I love playing volleyball and watching football.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 17px;">I am not so good at reading but I like a brazilian one about a brazilian volleyball coach. This book is about his biography. The name is <b>"Transformando o suor em ouro"</b> by our dear <a href="https://www.esportelandia.com.br/volei/bernardinho/"><p>"Bernardinho".</p></a>
