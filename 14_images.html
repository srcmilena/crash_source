<!--
    Images are like links, in that they require an attribute to work

    * A link uses thes href attribute to link to another file
    * Images use the src attribute, which is short for source

    <img src="image.jpg">

    Alt text
    * Images are not valid without an alt attribute
    * The alt attribute is used to describe the image
    * Should describe the intent of the image
    * Do not include "an image of"
    * If it is a decorative element or logo, it doesn't need alt text (but it does still require the alt attribute)
